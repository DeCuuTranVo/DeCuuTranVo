Hi, I am Tran, and I don't know what to do with my life. Meanwhile, I am learning computer science and artificial intelligence because I think it may enable me to create something useful for the community. With that said, I believe that becoming a doctor (not the medical type) and becoming a professional programmer afterward is the way to make my existence valuable and meaningful in some sense.  

This repository record my learning journey.
